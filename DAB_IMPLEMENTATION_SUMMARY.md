## üöÄ Deployed Resources

### Jobs and Workflows
1. **Feature Engineering Job** - Automated feature creation and feature store management
2. **Model Training Job** - Random Forest/Gradient Boosting training with MLflow
3. **Model Governance Job** - Healthcare-specific validation and promotion (using Python CLI)
4. **Batch Inference Job** - Daily patient scoring with business logic (scheduled 2 AM)
5. **Model Monitoring Job** - Drift detection and performance monitoring (scheduled 6 AM)
6. **ML Training Pipeline** - End-to-end orchestrated workflow with proper dependencies

### Infrastructure Resources
- **Development Cluster** - Interactive development environment
- **Inference Cluster** - Scalable batch processing cluster
- **MLflow Experiments** - Organized by component (feature engineering, training, governance, monitoring)
- **Model Serving Endpoints** - Real-time inference capabilities

### Environment Configuration
- **Development** - Single-node clusters for testing and development
- **Staging** - Scaled resources for pre-production validation
- **Production** - High-availability configuration with monitoring

## üîß Key Features Implemented

### Healthcare Compliance
- **HIPAA Compliance** - All data processing follows deidentification standards
- **Clinical Validation** - BMI categorization, age risk scoring, smoking impact factors
- **Governance Automation** - Automated model validation against healthcare industry standards
- **Audit Trails** - Complete lineage tracking through Unity Catalog

### MLOps Best Practices
- **Environment Separation** - Dev/Staging/Prod with appropriate configurations
- **Dependency Management** - Proper task sequencing and workflow orchestration
- **Resource Optimization** - Environment-specific cluster sizing and autotermination
- **Monitoring Integration** - Comprehensive drift detection and performance alerts

### Business Logic
- **Risk Categorization** - Low/Medium/High/Critical risk classification
- **Business Rules** - Minimum risk thresholds, confidence intervals, review flags
- **Healthcare Metrics** - High-risk patient identification, demographic fairness monitoring
- **Performance Targets** - R¬≤ ‚â• 0.70, MAE ‚â§ 15.0, High-Risk Accuracy ‚â• 60%

## üìä Governance and Validation

### Model Promotion Criteria
```yaml
Healthcare Requirements:
  - R¬≤ Score: ‚â• 0.70
  - Mean Absolute Error: ‚â§ 15.0 (for risk scores)
  - High-Risk Accuracy: ‚â• 60%
  - HIPAA Compliance: Required
  - Bias Testing: Automated
```

### Monitoring Thresholds
```yaml
Alert Conditions:
  - High MAE: > 15.0 triggers retraining alert
  - Low Volume: < 50 daily predictions triggers pipeline check
  - Drift Alert: Composite drift score > 0.3 triggers investigation
  - Demographic Bias: > 10% shift triggers review
```

## üéØ Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Databricks CLI** installed and configured
2. **Unity Catalog Access** with appropriate permissions
3. **Data Prerequisites** - silver_patients and dim_patients tables must exist

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Update configuration (workspace URLs, emails)
# Edit databricks.yml

# 2. Validate bundle
databricks bundle validate --target dev

# 3. Deploy to development
./deployment/deploy.sh -e dev

# 4. Run ML pipeline
databricks jobs run-now --job-name "[dev] Healthcare ML Training Pipeline"
```

### Environment Promotion
```bash
# Deploy to staging
./deployment/deploy.sh -e staging

# Deploy to production  
./deployment/deploy.sh -e prod
```

## üîç Validation Steps

After deployment, verify the following:

### 1. Resource Creation
```bash
# Check jobs were created
databricks jobs list --output table

# Verify experiments exist
databricks experiments list

# Check model registry
databricks models list
```

### 2. Job Execution
- Monitor feature engineering job completion
- Verify model training and registration
- Confirm governance validation passes
- Check batch inference produces predictions
- Validate monitoring setup creates views

### 3. Model Endpoints
- Verify model serving endpoint deployment
- Test real-time inference capabilities
- Monitor endpoint performance and scaling
